1) graph window should respond to a new algebra when window menu item chosen - to front 
	1a) menu item construct graph should bring graph window to front with algebra: 
	make graph in algebra operations should switch graph type to algebra like genological grid in Operations
//2) temporarily suspend menu options for ego type in tables (Operations) until actual differences implemented
3) Generally tidy up window positions 
4) same menu bar all around
5) investigate reversing graph vertical axis directions e.g. in paint adjust not only the origin,  
   but the direction of offset on vertical lines e.g. so 2 is above not below origin
6) when recursive line (top to bottom or side to side) on select bring bit outside term rectangle so can be selected.
// 7) prints the algebra is isomorphic twice in dialog box
// 8) in Tops/Bops (itemStateChanged Tops 218/Bops 268) a false opcode resets all menu items ... need to be be a little more subtle. See
// how to uncheck the last one only, not all; Need to record appropriate states and restore to last menu item. So probably a lastMenuitem variable
// combined with general undo (autoundo) -- also run down why is coming back false in the first place.

9) Need to destroy the prefs window when done, not merely hiding it.

10) When changing a term from Neutral to Gendered must check through every terms product list to remove incorrectly
 gendered terms (e.g. wrong generator from foreign term). Special checkfor changing sex of generator (to relations).

11) make busy cursor for make table from menu // graphs?

12) Centre bloody graph. Need to make graph window slightly taller?????????????????????????
