in KinshipTermsPanel:coverTerms

assuming that orientations must match.
added code to test for equivalence of products:

	TransferKinInfo tk1, tk2;
	tk1 = kw.lookupTerm(k1.getTheTerm());
	tk2 = kw.lookupTerm(k2.getTheTerm());

	if (! tk1.getProducts().equalvalentTo(tk12.getProducts())) {
	   Debug.prout(4,"coverTerms: "+k1.getTheTerm()+" not equivalent to "+k2.getTheTerm());
	   return;
	}


in  TransferKinInfoVector:mergeTerms

am always setting the generator status of the merged term to -1 (not a arrow)
	isAGenerator = false;
Should we make the same check in merge that we apply to dropMerge. Or should we assume that the calling routine will do what ever checks (and any reporting).

Merge generators is another routine already.
